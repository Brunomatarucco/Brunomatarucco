### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I'm Bruno! I'm actually quite new to this whole technology-as-a-way-of-living thing. I am a Psychologist and I have worked with language education ever since I was 17 (I am 27 now). During the second semester of the Covid pandemic I started studying Python and Data Science out of curiosity but every time I went deeper into my studies I realized I wanted to go even deeper, I decided then that I wanted to change my career path to become a Data Scientist. So I created this Github profile to help me achieve this goal and also help me keep organized, in touch with what is happening in the world and also being able to contribute to the community somehow

#### Projects

- Here is the [repository](https://github.com/Brunomatarucco/bootcamp_data_science_alura) in which I am using throughout the duration of the Data Science Bootcamp from Alura Cursos that I am attending. In this repository you will find the Jupyter Notebooks and the csvs used in the course. 

- [AnÃ¡lise ExploratÃ³ria Covid](https://github.com/Brunomatarucco/estudo_covid): in this repository I did a exploratory analysis of the data that has a number of cases and deaths in Brazil from the beginning of the pandemic until the middle of November. The greatest challenge faced in this project was that the database had city and state numbers, and ever since Brazil is a very big country with a large variety of number of citizens per city and state.

- [Cobertura Vacinal](https://github.com/Brunomatarucco/Cobertura_vacinal_aparelhamento): in this project I got the numbers of the vaccination coverages city-wise from 2010 to 2019 and I tested the hypothesis which the physical and human-resources-related infrastructure of the Health system from that city had a direct correlation with the vaccination coverage of that city. The biggest challenge here was connecting all the databases, for none of the data was available in the same databases provided by the government, everything had to be uploaded, cleaned, treated and appended to the main dataframe separately, so the effort put into the cleasing and treatment of the data was very thorough.

- [AnÃ¡lise PENSE](https://github.com/Brunomatarucco/Analise_PENSE): this analysis is a project with the database from The National Adolescent School-based Health Survey (PeNSE), which is a survey conducted with students from public and private schools about their health and experiences. In it I chose only some of the categories and questions from the survey to compare how they were answered by adolescents from different races/colors. The project on itself provided a good reflection on how people with different racial backgrounds have different experiences even in school.

- [AnÃ¡lise Temporal Covid](https://github.com/Brunomatarucco/Analise_temporal_covid): in this repository I took on a similiar analysis to the one done on a previous project (AnÃ¡lise ExploratÃ³ria Covid), but this time the idea was to analyse how the data is progressing as time passes and try to predict the future of cases and deaths due to Covid-19. The open source named Prophet from Facebook was the main tool in the prediction used in this study.

- [AnÃ¡lise Dados ClÃ­nicos Covid](https://github.com/Brunomatarucco/Covid-clinical-data): this was the last project done in the Data Science Bootcamp from Alura. The dataset was made available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/S%C3%ADrio-Libanes/covid19) by the hospital SÃ­rio Libanes in order to help them better predict and prepare their healthcare system and avoid collapse, defined by above capacity need of ICU beds, using individual clinical data - in lieu of epidemiological and populational data.
