### Hi there 👋

 I'm Bruno! I'm actually quite new to this whole technology-as-a-way-of-living thing. I am a Psychologist and I have worked with language education ever since I was 17 (I am 27 now). During the second semester of the Covid pandemic I started studying Python and Data Science out of curiosity but every time I went deeper into my studies I realized I wanted to go even deeper, I decided then that I wanted to change my career path to become a Data Scientist. So I created this Github profile to help me achieve this goal and also help me keep organized, in touch with what is happening in the world and also being able to contribute to the community somehow

#### Projects

#### Updates and Info

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project with the database from The National Adolescent School-based Health Survey (PeNSE), which is a survey conducted with students from public and private schools about their health and experiences.

- 🌱 I’m currently focusing my studies on Data Science tools/libraries for Python about data manipulation, data visualization, statistics and Machine Learning. I am also in learning SQL, ETL and AWS.
